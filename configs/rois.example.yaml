# ROI (Region of Interest) Configuration

      - name: danger_zone_1
        points:
          - [200, 150]

    alert_classes: [object]
    strict_mode: true  # NEW: Recommended to keep as true

# Notes:
# - Points are in pixel coordinates [x, y]
# - ROI polygons should be defined clockwise or counter-clockwise
# - strict_mode is RECOMMENDED for production (alerts on anything not explicitly allowed)
# - Use the ROI selector tool (examples/roi_selector.py) to define ROI points interactively
